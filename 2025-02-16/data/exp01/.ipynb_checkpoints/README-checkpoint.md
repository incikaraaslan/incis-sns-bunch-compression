# Experiment 01


## Description

We measured the beam as it was injected and stored with all ring rf cavities shorted.


## Details

Shorted all cavities. (This was done manually using mechanical relay in Ring Service Building.)
- Set Cav01 short=True.
- Set Cav02 short=True.
- Set Cav03 short=True.
- Set Cav04 short=True.

Measured the longitudinal beam distribution vs. time. 
- Saved BCM waveform. (ring-bcm)
- Saved LLRF waveforms. (ring-llrf)

Repeated without beam. (Should just give noise since all cavities are shorted). 
- Turned off beam.
- Saved BCM waveform. (beam-off/ring-bcm)
- Saved LLRF waveforms. (beam-off/ring-llrf)

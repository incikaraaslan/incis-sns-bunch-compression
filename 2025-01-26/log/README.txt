This evening we worked on bunch compression studies in the ring. The goal was to understand how much beam could be accumulated with the RF set to zero on the RF1 station, and all others shorted. Once we found this limit, the goal was to turn on the RF after the accumulation and create a narrow bunch length.

We found the limit on the accumulation to be around 300 injected turns or ~4e13ppp. We did not see any significant bunching with the RF turning on after 300 turns. Details below.



Study Notes:

-Beginning beam study on measuring effect of beam-induced RF voltage on Ring RF cavities.
-Chip and co are shorting cavities 2, 3 and 4, and will work only with cavity 1.
-Running beam at 1 Hz
-RF1 off but non-shorted
-PW On is 45, but this seems to cause a problem with one of the cavities. Operator is reducting to a more stable value
-Setting PW On to 42 which is stable.
-Walked up the number of injected turns from 10 to 300. Had some trouble with cavities tripping. Took snapshots of RF waveforms (and sometimes Ring BCM waveforms) for each setting
-ended up with a PW On of 42 and 300 turns. (See Ring BCMD09 screen below and LEBT chopper screen for settings).
-Now store for 800.
-Turned on RF at 300 turns; it ramps for 200 turns then is at max until extraction. Max voltage unknown but probably around 10kV.
-We changed the RF phase at the end, and it changed the induced voltage, but we did not see an effect on the Ring BCM09 waterfall plot. The different phases are shown in images below.

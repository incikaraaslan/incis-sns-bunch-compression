# Experiment 02

## Description

We stored the beam with a single unshorted cavity (h=1) and the cavity voltage set to 0. We measured the beam-induced voltage in the cavity for different numbers of injected turns. We saved screenshots of the LLRF waveforms [is raw data saved?]. We also saved the BCM waveforms.

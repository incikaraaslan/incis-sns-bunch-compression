# Experiment 07


## Description

The RF cavity voltage setpoint was scanned with feedback on. The goal was to see if the cavity could offset the beam-induced voltage.


## Details

- Set injected turns = 100.
- Set stored turns = 900.
- Set Cav04 short=True.
- Set Cav03 short=True.
- Set Cav02 short=True.
- Set Cav02 phase = 118 [deg] (nominal).
- Scan Cav02 amplitude:
    - scan-amp-01: 10.0 [kV]
    - scan-amp-02:  5.0 [kV]
    - scan-amp-03:  1.5 [kV]
    - scan-amp-04:  1.0 [kV]
    - scan-amp-05:  0.5 [kV]
    - scan-amp-06:  0.0 [kV]

- Saved BCM waveform (ring-bcm)
- Saved LLRF waveforms (ring-llrf)

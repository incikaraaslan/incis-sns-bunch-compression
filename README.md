## Inci's Modifications to the Bunch Compression Benchmarking Code for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (in PyORBIT) ##
- The dated folders contain experimental data from 2025-01-26 and 2025-02-16 beam studies and the subsequent plotting and analysis tools developed by Austin Hoover.
- The folder labelled "injection" contains the simulation benchmarking script using this experimental data: simplots.py (without Longitudinal Space Charge) and simplotslongsc.py (with Longitudinal Space Charge).
- An optimization script to find the optimized energy spread required for the simulation beams to match the experimental Probability Density v. z width has been implemented as optsimplotslongsc.py.

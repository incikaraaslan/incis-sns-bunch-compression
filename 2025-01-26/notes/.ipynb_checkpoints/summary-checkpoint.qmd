## Replay

1. We shorted all ring RF gaps except a single h=1.
2. We accumulated beam with the cavity voltage set to zero, then measured the cavity voltage and phase as a function of beam intensity.
3. We reached a maximum intensity of 300 minipulses (injected turns); at this point, the beam-induced cavity voltage was nearly 10 kV (near its maximum of 12 kV, after which the ferrite material may overheat).
4. We stored the beam for 800 turns after accumulation.
    1. Drive voltage set to zero 0.
    2. Drive voltage set to linearly increase after accumulation (ramp time is approximately 200 turns).
5. We measured the turn-by-turn longitudinal beam profiles in each case.


## Results

1. The LLRF screens show *measured* phase and amplitude. This includes the effect of beam loading.

2. We operated the RF cavities in *open-loop* instead of *closed-loop* mode. Closed loop operation was unstable. (In closed-loop operation, a feedback system ensures the measured voltages and phases are equal to their setpoints. In open-loop operation, there is no feedback.)

3. Because there was no feedback, we do not know the actual voltage and phase generated by the cavity (in the absence of beam loading).

4. The bunch did not decohere during accumulation but debunched during storage. It is likely that the measured RF voltage was quite small and that the measured rf phase wask not near the zero crossing (synchronous phase).

## Next experiment

1. Start with fewer injected turns (20-100) and closed-loop operation.
2. Store beam with all RF gaps shorted; this will provide a benchmark for future experiments.
4. Check the RF system timing.
3. Vary the cavity tuning current.
5. Request a longer physics shift. This experimentw as slowed down while changing the number of injected turns. I believe the issues were related to the AFF? This probably won't happen again.

# Experiment 04

## Description

We accumulated beam for 300 turns and stored for 800 turns. We used a single h=1 cavity and shorted the others. The cavity voltage was set to zero during accumulation and then ramped linearly starting after accumulation. The ramp time was approximately 200 turns and the maximum applied voltage was around 10 kV.

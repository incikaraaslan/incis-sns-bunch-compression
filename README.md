## Inci's Modifications to the Bunch Compression Benchmarking Code for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (in PyORBIT) ##
The dated folders contain experimental data from 2025-01-26 and 2025-02-16 beam studies and the subsequent plotting and analysis tools developed by Austin Hoover. The folder labelled as "injection" contains the simulation benchmarking script using this experimental data, simplots.py (without Longitudinal Space Charge), and simplotslongsc.py (with Longitudinal Space Charge). In addition, an optimization script to find the optimized energy spread required for the simulation beams to match the experimental Probability Density v. z width has been implemented as optsimplotslongsc.py.

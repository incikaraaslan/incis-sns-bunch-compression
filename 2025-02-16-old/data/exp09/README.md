# Experiment 09


## Description

We injected the beam with the h=1 cavity on a delayed ramp, starting immdediately after accumulation. We tried this in the 2025-01-26 experiment, but in that experiment we operated in open-loop, so there was no feedback to control the cavity voltage with beam loading.


## Details

The RF ramp time is ~200 turns. We used two cavities (Cav01, Cav02) each of which ramped from 0 kV to 10 kV.

- Case 01:  50 turns, delay 2817
- Case 02: 150 turns, delay 2917
- Case 03: 150 turns, delay 2817
- Case 04: 300 turns, delay 2817

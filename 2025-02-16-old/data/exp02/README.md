# Experiment 02


## Description

The goal of this experiment was to accumulate and store the beam with constant h=1 cavity voltage and phase. The total h=1 voltage was set to 10 kV, with all h=2 cavities shorted. The cavities were operated in closed-loop, meaning the drive voltage and phase varied during the beam pulse to fix the *measured* voltage at 10 kV --- this includes the effect of beam loading.

The cases below vary the number of injected turns as well as the cavity phases for benchmarking purposes.


## Case 01

- Set Cav01 voltage = 10 [kV]
- Set injected turns = 100
- Set stored turns = 900
- Saved LLRF waveforms (ring-llrf)
- Saved BCM waveforms (ring-bcm)


## Case 02

- Set Cav01 voltage = 10 [kV]
- Set Cav01 voltage = 10 [kV]
- Set injected turns = 200
- Set stored turns = 900
- Saved LLRF waveforms (ring-llrf)
- Saved BCM waveforms (ring-bcm)


## Case 03

- Set Cav01 voltage = 10 [kV]
- Set injected turns = 300
- Set stored turns = 900
- Saved LLRF waveforms (ring-llrf)
- Saved BCM waveforms (ring-bcm)


## Case 04

- Set Cav01 voltage = 5 [kV]
- Set Cav02 voltage = 5 [kV]
- Scanmed Cav02 phases: {-40, 20, 100, 160} [deg]. results are stored in folders {phase-01, phase-02 phase-03, phase-04}.
    - Saved LLRF waveforms (ring-llrf)
    - Saved BCM waveform (ring-bcm)

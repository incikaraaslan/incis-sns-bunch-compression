Experiment 1:
- Bunching cavities are shorted, PW On 36, Injection Turns 300, Extraction Kicker 700.

Experiment 2:
- Folder rated for Wire Scanners, named 2025-02-16 under Profile Tools and Analysis
Case 3:
- First cavity is in closed loop at about 10 kV and 118 degrees, PW On 36, Injection Turns 300, Extraction Kicker 900. RIM is not working.
Case 4:
- Same settings as Case 3 but the two h=1 cavities are in closed loop at about 5 kV each.
- Now we have varied LLRF 2 (Station 1.2) phase, up until this point LLRF 2 phase was at 100 degrees.
Case 2:
- Injection turns decresaed to 200 while keeping storage turns at 900.
- Injection turns decreased now to 100.

Experiment 7:
Changing the set amplitude of the RF cavity with feedback on, 100 injection / 900 storage turns
- Single h=1 cavity on with 1.5 kV instead of 10 kV
- Also tried 0.5 kV, 5 kV

Experiment 8:
Two RF cavities are set at 5 kV each with 180 phase difference, the beam is accumulated for 100 turns at PWON of 36, 900 storage turns, the second cavity is turned off immediately after accumulation to mimic instantaneous turn on of a single 5 kV cavity.
case 1: Phases at nominal, both cavities at 5kV
case 2: Second cavity phase at 180 degree shift
case 3: Turned off second cavity after 100 turns
case 4: Same as case three but with only 10 turns of accumulation

Experiment 9 (aka Experiment 4 on the plan):
50 turn injection, 900 turn storage, RF drive off during accumulation, two cavities start ramping in phase at the beginning of injection, feedback on
case 1: two cavities at 10 kV each, 118 on RF#1, 100 on RF#2, delay from the cycle start 2817, 200 turn ramp up
case 2: 150 turns, delay 2917
case 3: 150 turns, delay 2817
case 4: 300 turns, delay 2817

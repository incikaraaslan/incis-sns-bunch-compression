# Data

Experiments labeled "exp01", "exp02", etc. represent different sections of the beam study period. Typically, each experiment addresses a specific question or corresponds to a general machine state. The goals, organization, naming conventions for each experiment are listed in a separate README file within the experiment folder.

Within each experiment, we've tried to identify different cases labeled "case01", "case02", etc. Typically these cases look at smaller changes to the machine state, not warranting a new experiment. For single-parameter scans, we label the folders "scan-<variable>-01", "scan-<variable>-02", etc. with the variable values listed in the README.
